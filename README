OPEN MACRO LIBRARY
============================================================


Description
------------------------------------------------------------
Open Macro Library is a library of highly reusable C macros providing
a set of well-designed commonly needed functionality to C developers,
like logging and debugging helpers, containers, sorting and other
algorithms.

Specifically, a simple to use API is planned to be designed and
implemented that exposes to applications the following functionality:

* containers: vector, queue, stack, list (standard, circular,
  double-linked), tree (binary, binary double-linked), heap
  (array-based and tree-based), quick-extraction heap, hashmap;
* iterators;
* synchronization primitives (monitors and condition variables);
* synchronized containers: pthread-based wrappers for the above types;
* algorithms: sorting, randomizing;
* logging (configurable log levels and the sort);
* debugging (memory allocation tracing, leakages detection);
* exception handling;
* OO typing (inheritance, support for associations);
* serialization.

Note
------------------------------------------------------------
This archive has been created for the only purpose of easying
the task to download OML, so that people may give a feedback
on the design, syntax, etc. Actually, the current version is
not yet complete and just a few types are actually complete.
