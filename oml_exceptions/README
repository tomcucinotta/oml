EXCEPTIONS FOR C - Version 0.1.0
=======================================================================
Copyright(c) 1998-2008 Alessandro Evangelista
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This package implements exception handling for the C language,
through the use of a set of well-designed macros that mimic
the C++ syntax for exception management.

The project was originally developed for an exam at university.

The syntax has been recently adapted by Tommaso Cucinotta, for
the purpose of including the package within the Open Macro
Library project (http://oml.sourceforge.net), and distributing
it in a reusable form.


REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This package requires:
- Doxygen, in order to build automatically the user manual from sources


COMPILE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just type `make'. The `make doc' target builds the documentation
in the doc/ subfolder.


INSTALL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the dynamically linkable library and the oml_exceptions.h header
file wherever you can access them on your system (i.e., respectively,
in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include).


DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The user-manual is automatically generated from the sources using
Doxygen, as a consequence of the `make doc' target.
For a few examples of usage, check out the examples/ subfolder.


KNOWN BUGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
None at the moment. In case you find a bug, please report by using the
OML mailing list.
